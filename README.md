Muon Lifetime fitting Code

This code was written to fit an exponential curve to a muon decay time distribution from data recorded by the TeachSpin Muon detector. The fitting process is repeated 3 times to reduced the background noise in the distribution. 500 ns was subtracted from all recorded times to eliminate an outlier region in the data.
